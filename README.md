# Zero to Full Stack Hero // Our First App Module

## This is the first module of the PAPA React course ðŸš€

This project was created with [npx create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

I used yarn, it seems to be more efficient than npm.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
